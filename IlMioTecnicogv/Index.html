<p style="font-size: larger;">I am a young self-taught computer scientist, passionate and fascinated by information technology.
    This passion leads me to research and discover new methods and strategies to get  an unconventional way for problem's resolutions .
    My passion has led me to cover various roles, which to date have created a versatile profile, but still eager for professional growth.    
    Currently I deal with remote and physical assistance for customers with business and not that assistance of IT consultancy, sale and repair of electronic devices, solutions for data storage, etc.
    During the Covid period I offered assistance to many students and families who for the first time approached the world of information technology due to force majeure.
    This is allowed to me thanks to the notions learned in the years of studies in the IT field.</p>
